Task 1:
The first task involved creating a JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js with a function called processArray. This function takes an array of numbers as input, squares each even number, and triples each odd number. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the output array would be [3, 4, 9, 16].

Task 2:
The second task involved adding a new function called formatArrayStrings to the arrayManipulation.js file. This function takes two arrays as input, an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function. It then modifies each string in the first array based on the corresponding number in the second array. If the number is even, the string is capitalized; if the number is odd, the string is lowercased. For example, if the input arrays are ['hello', 'world'] and [2, 3], the output array would be ['HELLO', 'world'].

Task 3:
The third task involved creating a new JavaScript file named userInfo.js with a function called createUserProfiles. This function takes an array of names and an array of modified names as input, and returns an array of objects with originalName, modifiedName, and auto-incremented id. For example, if the input arrays are ['John', 'Mary'] and ['JOHN', 'MARY'], the output array would be [{ originalName: 'John', modifiedName: 'JOHN', id: 1 }, { originalName: 'Mary', modifiedName: 'MARY', id: 2 }].
